# Prebiotic galactooligosaccharide feed modifies the chicken gut microbiota to efficiently clear *Salmonella*.

## Abstract
Chicken meat is contaminated with *Salmonella* originating from the gut of 
infected chickens during slaughter. Eradication of *Salmonella* from broiler 
(meat) chickens through hygiene measures and/or vaccination is not cost-effective, 
so complementary approaches are sought. A mature gut microbiota obstructs 
*Salmonella* infection in chickens and deliberate fortification of colonization 
resistance through prebiotic feed formulations would benefit public health and 
the poultry industry. Prebiotic galactooligosaccharides have been shown to hasten 
clearance of *Salmonella* from the gut of infected chickens. To better understand 
the role of galactooligosaccharides in colonization resistance broiler chickens 
were raised on a wheat-soybean meal-based feed, with or without added 
galactooligosaccharide for the first 24-days of life. Chickens were then orally 
challenged with *Salmonella enterica* serovar Enteritidis at 20-days-old and the 
effect of supplementary galactooligosaccharides characterized by profiling 
*Salmonella* colonization, gut microbiota, innate immune response and cecal SCFA 
concentrations. Exposure to dietary galactooligosaccharides shortened the time to 
clear *S*. Enteritidis from the ceca. Differential abundance analysis of the cecal 
microbiota associated *Salmonella*-challenge with a bacterial taxon belonging to 
the Acidaminococcaceae family. Increased cecal concentrations of the short-chain 
fatty acids propionate and valerate were measured in *Salmonella*-challenged 
chickens sustained on either control or galactooligosaccharide-supplemented feed 
relative to mock-challenged controls; but far greater concentrations were detected 
in chickens fed a galactooligosaccharide-supplemented diet in early life. 
Propionate and valerate concentrations corresponded with the abundance of the 
Acidaminococcaceae taxon. The absence of cecal proinflammatory transcriptional 
responses suggest that the rapid *Salmonella*-clearance observed for the 
galactooligosaccharide-supplemented diet was not linked to innate immune function.

## Importance
We hypothesise that catabolism of galactooligosaccharide and its breakdown products 
by indigenous taxa colonizing the cecal pouches yield excess levels of propionate. 
In the absence of gross inflammation propionate is inimical to *Salmonella* 
which hastens the clearance time. Work presented here identifies some of 
the bacterial taxa responsible for colonization resistance to *Salmonella* colonization 
in broiler chickens. Deliberate cultivation of these taxa with prebiotic 
galactooligosaccharide has potential as a straight-forward, safe and cost-effective 
intervention against *Salmonella*.
