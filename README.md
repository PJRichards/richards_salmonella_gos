# Prebiotic galactooligosaccharide feed modifies the chicken gut microbiota to efficiently clear *Salmonella*.

## Abstract  

### Background
Chicken meat can be contaminated with *Salmonella* originating from the 
gastrointestinal tract of infected chickens during slaughter. Total eradication 
of *Salmonella* from flocks of broiler (meat) chickens through hygiene measures 
and/or vaccination regimes is not deemed cost-effective, so complementary 
approaches are sought. A mature gut microbiota is an obstruction to *Salmonella* 
infection in chickens and deliberate fortification of colonization resistance in 
juvenile chickens through prebiotic feed formulations would benefit both public 
health and the poultry industry. Prebiotic galactooligosaccharides have been 
shown to hasten clearance of *Salmonella* from the gut of infected chickens. To 
better understand the role of galactooligosaccharides in colonization resistance 
broiler chickens were raised on a wheat-soybean meal-based feed, with or without 
added galactooligosaccharide for the first 24-days of life. Chickens were then 
orally challenged with *Salmonella enterica* serovar Enteritidis at 20-days-old 
and the effect of supplementary galactooligosaccharides characterized by 
profiling *Salmonella* colonization, gut microbiota, host innate immune response 
and cecal SCFA concentrations.

### Results
Exposure to dietary galactooligosaccharides shortened the time required for 
chickens to clear *S.* Enteritidis from the ceca. Differential abundance analysis 
of the cecal microbiota associated *Salmonella*-challenge with a bacterial taxon 
belonging to the Acidaminococcaceae family. Increased concentrations of the short 
chain fatty acids propionate and valerate were measured in the ceca of 
*Salmonella*-challenged chickens sustained on either control or 
galactooligosaccharide-supplemented feed relative to mock-challenged controls; 
but far greater concentrations were detected in chickens fed a 
galactooligosaccharide-supplemented diet in early life. Propionate and valerate 
concentrations corresponded with the abundance of the Acidaminococcaceae taxon. 
The absence of cecal proinflammatory chemokine/cytokine transcriptional 
responses suggest that the *Salmonella*-clearance observed for the 
galactooligosaccharide-supplemented diet was not linked to the modulation of 
innate immune function.

### Conclusions
We hypothesise that catabolism of galactooligosaccharide and its breakdown 
products by indigenous taxa colonizing the cecal pouch yields excess levels of 
propionate. In the absence of gross inflammation propionate is inimical to 
*Salmonella*, which hastens the clearance time. Work presented here identifies 
some of the bacterial taxa responsible for colonization resistance to *Salmonella* 
colonization in broiler chickens. Deliberate cultivation of these taxa with 
prebiotic galactooligosaccharide presents a straight-forward, safe and 
cost-effective intervention against *Salmonella*.
